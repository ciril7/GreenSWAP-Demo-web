# 🌱 GreenSwap

GreenSwap is a simple web platform that promotes sustainability by enabling users to exchange or donate reusable items instead of throwing them away.  
Built with **Node.js + Express (backend)** and **HTML/CSS/JS (frontend)**, it provides a minimal, easy-to-use solution for item swapping.

## 🚀 Features
- Add items (name, category, price, contact details)  
- View all available items in a clean UI  
- Data stored in a local JSON file (no external DB required)  
- Runs locally on your computer with **npm start**
